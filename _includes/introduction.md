# Welcome to juicelang.org!

*juice* is an open-source programming language, currently in development, which is statically typed, has a clean and
modern syntax and is easy to use. It is based on LLVM as the code-generating backend.
Thanks to its type-system, which ensures memory- and thread-safety, *juice* prevents many bugs already at
compile-time.
The syntax and functionality of *juice* derives from multiple modern languages, like Swift, Rust, C++, and Python.

At the moment, the first version of *juice* is in active development. You can take a look at the state of things in the
[*juice* GitHub repository](https://github.com/juice-lang/juice).
The `type-checker` branch already features control-flow, semantic analysis, and LLVM IR generation.

This website is in the development stage as well. In the future, it will contain the documentation of the language, a blog,
a playground for trying out the language online, and much more.
